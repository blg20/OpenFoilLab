# OpenFoilLab
Exploration of an open-source tool-chain to improve the preliminary design and analysis of composite hydrofoils. 

## Project Content

OpenFoilLab is a proof of concept software to design foils parametrically and automatically analyse their structure and hydrodynamics. 
It uses Grasshopper for parametric design and existing open-source code to run the section, fluid and beam analyses. 

This GitHub repository contains: 
- the Rhino/Grasshopper files used to generate the foil shape
- 'workflow.png' which shows the current OpenFoilLab structure and workflow for the user
- a comprehensive list of all the parameters required to for the full OpenFoilLab workflow
- a UI folder which contains views of the front-end
- other code and input/output files used throughout
