# OpenFoilLab
Exploration of an open-source tool-chain to improve the preliminary design and analysis of composite hydrofoils. 

## Project Content

OpenFoilLab is a proof of concept software to design foils parametrically and automatically analyse their structure and hydrodynamic properties. 
It uses Grasshopper for parametric design and existing open-source code to run the section, fluid and beam analyses. 

This GitHub repository contains: 
- the Rhino/Grasshopper files used to generate the foil shape
- 'workflow.png' the current OpenFoilLab structure and workflow for the user
- 'parameters.xls' a comprehensive list of the parameters required throughout the OpenFoilLab workflow
- 'UI' a UI folder which contains views of the front-end
- other code and input/output files used throughout
